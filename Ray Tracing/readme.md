Amit Rao (200109722)

1. To Run the program open the index.html file

2. The homepage contains three sections: Blinn Phong Illumination
   and Extra Credit sections: Arbitrary size image, and shadows

3. The Blinn-Phong Illumination is the default program with settings
      Viewport = 512*512
      Eye located at [0.5,0.5,-0.5]
      Viewport center at [0.5,0.5,0]
      Light Source at [2,4,-0.5]
   To run the program click the Run button on homepage

4. Extra Credit: Arbitrarily sized images and viewports
   Takes two inputs, Width and Height of the Viewport.
   On entering the dimensions and clicking Render it will show the output of
   the Blinn-Phong program with specified user window dimension.

5. Extra Credit: Shadows takes the light source location as the input.
   The program demonstrates the ray tracing program for two conditions with
   shadows 'On' or 'Off' for the particular light location. Here the specular
   component is taken to be 15.
