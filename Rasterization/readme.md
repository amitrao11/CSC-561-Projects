Program 1: Rasterization
Amit Rao (200109722)

1. To Run the program open the index.html file

Note: JSON files are hardcoded in the program

2. To interactively change the view of spheres and triangles press any of the keys mentioned below.

   a and d — to translate view left and right along view X
   w and s — to translate view forward and backward along view Z
   q and e — to translate view up and down along view Y

   A and D — to rotate view left and right around view Y
   W and S — to rotate view forward and backward around view X
   Q and E — to rotate selection counter-clockwise and clockwise around view Z

   escape — to undo all view changes and to restore to default view

Note: Press the Shift key to get the effect for Capital Lettered keys
Example: Shift + a --> To rotate view left around view Y

3. To interactively translate and rotate the objects.

   Navigate between objects using left, right, down and up arrow keys.

   Where,
   left and right — to select and highlight the next/previous triangle set
   up and down — to select and highlight the next/previous sphere
   space - to deselect and turn off highlight for the object

   To translate/rotate objects press any of the keys mentioned below.
   k and ; — to translate selection left and right along view X
   o and l — to translate selection forward and backward along view Z
   i and p — to translate selection up and down along view Y
   K and : — to rotate selection left and right around view Y (yaw)
   O and L — to rotate selection forward and backward around view X (pitch)
   I and P — to rotate selection clockwise and counterclockwise around view Z (roll)
   backspace — to undo all sphere and triangle transformations

Note: Press the Shift key to get the effect for Capital Lettered keys
